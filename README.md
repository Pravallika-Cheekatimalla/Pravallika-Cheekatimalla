# Hey there, fellow human! 👋 I'm Pravallika Cheekatimalla

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub! 🌍 I'm a code ninja by day and a data wizard by night, currently on a quest to master all things computer science and data sorcery.

## 🚀 About Me
- 🎓 Apprentice at the School of Data Magic (a.k.a. **Clemson University**) 
- 💻 Professional bug wrangler with a knack for turning coffee into code
- 🌱 Always learning, always experimenting – because who needs a comfort zone?

## 🛠️ Skills (or Superpowers)
- **Languages**: Fluent in Java, Python, C++, and sarcasm 🤓
- **Tools**: From Eclipse to IntelliJ – if it has a button, I've probably pressed it.
- **ETL and Data Management**: I make data dance with Spectrum and other magical tools.

## 🌟 Fun Facts
- 📈 Once made a database query 30% faster just by giving it a motivational speech. 🗣️
- 🧙‍♂️ Survived countless project Go-Lives without turning into a pumpkin (yet).
- 🏆 Awarded "Most Likely to Debug Code in Their Sleep" three years running.

## 📫 How to Reach Me
- Carrier pigeon preferred, but [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pravallika-cheekatimalla-31574012a/) works too!
- Or send me a digital owl at [cheekatimalla.pravallika@gmail.com](mailto:cheekatimalla.pravallika@gmail.com) 🦉

## 🔍 What's in the Repository?
Just a few spells and potions (aka projects) to make life easier, data cleaner, and software smoother. Feel free to browse, borrow, or contribute – collaboration is my favorite magic trick! ✨



Thanks for dropping by! May your code compile on the first try! 🌟
